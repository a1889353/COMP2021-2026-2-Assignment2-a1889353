# Recipe Management System — Student Starter

Starter repository for Parts A and B. Implement `RecipeManager` in Core; the Application menu and JSON loader are supplied.

## What is supplied

- `RecipeManagement.Core/Models/` — recipe model classes
- `RecipeManagement.Core/RecipeLoader.cs` — reads `data/recipes.json`
- `RecipeManagement.Core/IRecipeManager.cs` — public API
- `RecipeManagement.Application/` — console menu (options labelled PartA / PartB)
- `RecipeManagement.Tests/` — example tests
- `data/recipes.json` — recipe dataset

## What you implement

**Part A** — `RecipeManager.cs` using:

- `Dictionary<int, Recipe>`
- `List<string>`
- `LinkedList<int>`
- `Stack<int>`
- `Queue<string>`

**Part B** — LINQ searches, protein report, saved-recipe collection, `Design.md`, and more tests.

## Build and run

Open `StudentPackage/RecipeManagement.sln`:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run --project RecipeManagement.Application -- data/recipes.json
```

Until you implement `RecipeManager`, menu options print a **Not implemented** message.

## AI acknowledgement

I used Claude to consolidate both the specification and scenario documents into small incremental steps of development so I could implement each working function, run the required unit tests to verify functionality and commit/push prior to starting the next component. I also used it to interpret a particular CS8600 nullable warning which came from how I originally wrote my queue accessors, and to clarify when its appropriate to use an expression bodied member in place of a block body. I did not copy or adapt AI-generated code or other material into my submission. I developed the submitted solution myself based on my understanding of the course material.
